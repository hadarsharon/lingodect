A Hound chased a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, the Hound stopped chasing. A goat-herd who was watching laughed at the Hound and said:

"The little Hare is the better runner of you two!"

The Hound replied:

"But you do not see the difference between us: I was only running for a dinner; he was running for his life."
